# Architecture rules

## Environment variables

When adding a new required environment variable to any service:
1. Add it to `.env` (docker-compose local dev values).
2. Add it to `dockerhub/.env` (production/hub values).
3. Add it to **every** `launch.json` that launches that service — both the service-specific one (`web_vms/.vscode/launch.json`, `media_server/.vscode/launch.json`) and the root `.vscode/launch.json`. Missing it in any one of these causes a startup crash in dev.

## Inter-service communication: config changes via pub/sub

When a service needs to react to a configuration change that originated in another service, use the **pub/sub pattern** — do not poll or call the source service directly on every request.

**Rule:** VmsCfg is the single source of truth for all configuration (cameras, storages, recording profiles, MediaMTX servers, etc.). Any other service that caches or acts on this configuration must subscribe to change events published by VmsCfg, then fetch the updated data itself.

**Pattern:**
1. VmsCfg publishes an event to a topic (e.g. `camera-config-changed`, `storage-config-changed`) after a write operation succeeds.
2. The subscriber receives the event and invalidates its local cache or re-fetches the relevant slice of config from VmsCfg via gRPC.
3. The subscriber never assumes the event payload contains the full new state — it only uses the event as a signal to pull fresh data.

**Existing examples in this codebase:**
- `CfgServiceImpl.InvalidateFsCache` publishes `camera-config-changed` → `VmsFs.CameraConfigSubscriber` re-fetches camera config.
- `StorageServiceImpl` publishes `storage-config-changed` → `VmsFs.CameraStorageSubscriber` re-fetches storage assignments.

**Do not:**
- Add a direct gRPC call from service A to VmsCfg inside a hot path (e.g. per-request, per-packet) to read config that rarely changes — cache it and invalidate via pub/sub instead.
- Embed config values in event payloads as the authoritative state — events are notifications, not data carriers.

## Docker image versions

In `docker-compose.yml` use `latest` for all third-party images. Do not pin specific version tags (e.g. `1.14.4`) — use `latest` instead.
